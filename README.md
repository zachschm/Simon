I had such a great time developing my first web based game today. The name of the game is Simon, a memory based game where the user needs to remember the order of colors and repeat back the proper order. While the game is relatively simple, building the game allowed me to develop a much greater understanding of JS and jQuery. Implementing the logic behind the game using JS was a blast. This was my first web development project to really allow my problem solving mind to take over. I was able to create many functions with inner calls and play around with so many for loops. It was a key step to see the final product to get a better understanding of seamlessly functioning JS within a web page. This project allowed me to really nail down how to properly use event listeners and be able to control them much more efficiently. The greatest challenge came in being able to reset the game seamlessly. This took lots of playing around with resetting various arrays and variables and knowing the exact spots to call hide() and show() functions within the program. I am looking forward to growing my JS skillset more and more in the future.
